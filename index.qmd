Hi! I'm Gabi, an experimental physicist navigating life between the laboratory and space. My interest is in laboratory astrophysics and astrochemistry, meaning I work with molecules that are present in the interstellar medium, the space between the stars. Even though all molecules are beautiful, I have a favorite family called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). While I'm trying to understand their photophysics, relaxation channels, and possible formation pathways, I am especially excited about contributing to the efforts of detecting PAHs in space using high-resolution rotational spectroscopy in the lab and radio telescopes such as the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia!</div>
